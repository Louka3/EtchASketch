An 'Etch-A-Sketch' project from The Odin Project Foundations path. Utilizes everything I've learned so far about HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Final thoughts: This was the first project almost completely on my own. The Odin Project gave us a couple tips but besides that there was no
real hand holding this time around. It was a little challenging but really helped me realize google is my friend and that I shouldn't be afraid to put my questions in the search bar. There are a lot of resources to help answer any questions I may have.
